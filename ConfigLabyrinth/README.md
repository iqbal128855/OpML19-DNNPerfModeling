CONFIG-LABYRINTH:  
This application computes inference time and power consumption during inference 
of different models (ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3) for various 
system configurations.

Example:  
to use resnet50 model:  
command: python RunConfigLabyrinth.py -o resnet50  

to use vgg16 model:  
command: python RunConfigLabyrinth.py -o vgg16
